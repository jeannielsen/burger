# EatDaBurger

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not
The app is deployed to Heroku so other users can fill it out.

## Languages Used
Node, Javascript, Express, AJAX, jQuery, Handlebars, MYSQL


## Take Aways

Really struggle with this one.  The devour buttons were not working and I spent far to much time attempting to troubleshoot the issue. 
The page looks fine on the local server, although the buttons were not functioning, but when deployed GitHub only shows the word burger 
Heroku states "Application Error".  Really off week for me.
